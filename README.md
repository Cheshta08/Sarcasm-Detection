Sarcasm Detection in Tweets
Overview
This project aims to detect sarcasm in tweets by using a combination of traditional machine learning models and advanced deep learning architectures. The solution involves a multi-step process for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. The dataset includes multilingual data with a focus on sarcasm detection in both English and Hindi (in Roman script).

Key Components
1. Data Preprocessing
Tokenization: Splitting tweets into individual tokens (words) for structured analysis.
POS Tagging: Assigning grammatical tags to tokens for syntactic analysis.
Label Encoding: Transforming sarcasm labels into numerical format for model training.
Language Detection and Translation: Identifying and translating Hindi words (written in Roman script) into English for consistency.
Emoji Analysis: Converting emojis into text descriptions to capture their emotional context.
2. Feature Extraction
Pragmatic Features: Capturing tweet-specific features such as tweet length, user mentions, capitalized words, etc.
Sentiment Features: Using sentiment analysis tools (e.g., Vader) to extract emotional tone from tweets, including emoji sentiment.
Syntactic Features: Extracting syntactic patterns based on part-of-speech (POS) tags.
Topic Modeling: Applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover thematic content in tweets.
3. Model Training and Evaluation
Several machine learning and deep learning models were trained using the extracted features:

Machine Learning Models
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised learning model used for binary classification of sarcastic vs. non-sarcastic tweets.
Logistic Regression: A classification model used to predict sarcasm by analyzing features of the tweets.
Deep Learning Models
Deep Neural Networks (DNN): A fully connected deep learning architecture used to learn complex feature representations.
Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM): A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) used for capturing the sequential context and long-term dependencies in tweets.
Attention Models: Used to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to focus on important parts of the tweet for better sarcasm detection.
